Sadly, us teachers have so many things to do every day and we spend such loooong hours in preparing all our classes...if only there was... 

Instanteach! We are building an "English Material Generator", in order to save us all hours of work and to give material of the highest quality to your students.

How does it work? 

1) Open the Material Generator.
2) Give us some basic info about your class
3) Submit! You'll receive an email within 24h with ready-to-use material personalized to your students' neccesities.
4) And Repeat! You can resubmit the form as many times as you need for as many groups as you have ;)
